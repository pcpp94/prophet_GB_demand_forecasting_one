    "### Key Concept:\n",
    "Stan performs **Bayesian inference**, where it estimates the posterior distributions of the model parameters (like trend, seasonality, and noise). Rather than producing single point estimates for parameters, Stan provides **distributions** for these parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happens for Each Time Point:\n",
    "For every single time point $t$, Prophet uses Stan to sample from the posterior distributions of all relevant parameters (such as trend, seasonality, and noise). Here's what this entails:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trend Distribution**:\n",
    "   - For each time point, Stan samples from the distribution of the trend parameters ($k$, $m$, and changepoints $\\delta$). This provides a range of possible trend values for that point.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Seasonality and Holiday Distribution**:\n",
    "   - Similarly, for each time point, Stan samples from the posterior distribution of the **seasonality** and **holiday** coefficients ($\\beta$).\n",
    "   - These sampled values are used to calculate the contribution of seasonality and holidays at each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Noise Distribution**:\n",
    "   - Stan also samples from the distribution of the noise parameter ($\\sigma_{\\text{obs}}$) for each time point. This accounts for the uncertainty or randomness in the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "Yes, Stan generates distributions for all the components (trend, seasonality, holidays, and noise) for each time point in the time series. These distributions reflect the uncertainty in the model parameters and result in a **posterior distribution** for each point, which Prophet summarizes as point estimates (`yhat`) and uncertainty intervals (`yhat_lower`, `yhat_upper`)."

    "Stan obtains the **posterior distributions** for each time step by using **Bayesian inference**, specifically through a method called **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** sampling. Here’s how the process works step-by-step in the context of Prophet:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Model Setup**:\n",
    "In Prophet, the time-series model consists of parameters like **trend** (with growth rate $k$, intercept $m$, and changepoints $\\delta$), **seasonality**, **holiday effects**, and **observation noise** ($\\sigma_{\\text{obs}}$). These parameters are assigned **prior distributions**, reflecting initial beliefs before observing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Bayesian Inference**:\n",
    "In Bayesian inference, the goal is to estimate the **posterior distribution** of the model parameters after observing the data. The posterior distribution combines:\n",
    "- **Priors** (beliefs about the parameters before seeing the data) and\n",
    "- **Likelihood** (how well the model explains the observed data).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **posterior distribution** is mathematically expressed as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\theta | y) \\propto P(y | \\theta) P(\\theta)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\theta$ represents the parameters (like $k$, $m$, $\\delta$).\n",
    "- $y$ is the observed data (the time-series).\n",
    "- $P(y | \\theta)$ is the **likelihood** (how probable the data is, given the parameters).\n",
    "- $P(\\theta)$ is the **prior** distribution for the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **MCMC Sampling with Stan**:\n",
    "Stan uses **MCMC sampling** to draw samples from the **posterior distribution** of the parameters. MCMC works by constructing a chain of samples that approximate the posterior distribution. Here's how it happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps of MCMC Sampling:\n",
    "1. **Initialization**:\n",
    "   - Stan starts by initializing the parameters $\\theta$ (e.g., $k$, $m$, $\\delta$) at some random values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Likelihood Computation**:\n",
    "   - For each parameter set $\\theta$, Stan computes the likelihood $P(y | \\theta)$, which measures how well the model with these parameter values explains the observed time-series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Posterior Sampling**:\n",
    "   - Using the likelihood and the priors, Stan evaluates the posterior probability for the current set of parameters.\n",
    "   - It then uses an MCMC algorithm (like **No-U-Turn Sampler**, a variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) to move through the parameter space, iteratively drawing samples from the posterior distribution.\n",
    "   - These samples represent possible values of $k$, $m$, and $\\delta$ that explain the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Convergence**:\n",
    "   - As the MCMC algorithm iterates, the chain converges toward the true posterior distribution, meaning that the samples start accurately representing the probability distribution of the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Posterior for Each Time Step**:\n",
    "Once Stan has a set of posterior samples for the parameters, it can compute the trend (and other components) for each time step:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For a Single Time Step $t$:\n",
    "For each time step, Stan uses the sampled parameters $k$, $m$, and $\\delta$ to compute the **trend** for that specific time step:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Trend}(t) = (k + \\sum_{i=1}^{C} \\delta_i \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{t > \\text{cp}_i}) \\cdot t + m\n",
    "$$\n",
    "This is done for each sample from the MCMC chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For Each Sample**: A specific value of $k$, $m$, and $\\delta$ from the posterior is used to compute a trend value for time $t$.\n",
    "- **Repeat for All Samples**: Since there are thousands of MCMC samples, this results in a **distribution of trend values** for each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For the Entire Time Series:\n",
    "Stan repeats this process for every time step in the time series. By using the sampled posterior distributions of the parameters at each step, it builds **distributions of the trend** across the entire time series. These distributions incorporate all sources of uncertainty from the model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Final Output**:\n",
    "After MCMC sampling is completed, Prophet extracts the following information:\n",
    "- **Point Estimate**: The **mean** (or median) of the posterior distribution for each time step’s trend is reported as the scalar prediction (e.g., `yhat`).\n",
    "- **Uncertainty Intervals**: The **credible intervals** (e.g., 95% intervals) are derived from the quantiles of the posterior distribution for each time step, reflecting the uncertainty in the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Steps for Each Time Step:\n",
    "1. **Set Up Priors**: For parameters like $k$, $m$, and $\\delta$, Stan uses prior distributions (e.g., normal, Laplace).\n",
    "2. **Sampling from Posterior**: Stan performs MCMC sampling to generate samples from the posterior distribution of these parameters, based on the observed data.\n",
    "3. **Compute Trend for Each Time Step**: For each time step, Stan calculates the trend using the sampled parameter values, resulting in a distribution of trend values.\n",
    "4. **Extract Results**: The point estimate (mean/median) and credible intervals are extracted from the distribution for each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this for every time step, Stan helps build the full **posterior distribution** for the entire time series, allowing Prophet to give both point predictions and uncertainty intervals."

    "The trend at time-step $t = 30$ (or any other time step) is **related** to the trends at previous and future time steps because **the same underlying parameters** (e.g., growth rate $k$, intercept $m$, and changepoints $\\delta$) affect the trend across all time steps. However, the exact trend value at each time step is influenced by how these parameters interact with the time step itself and any potential changepoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points to Understand:\n",
    "1. **Same Distribution of Parameters**: The entire time series is influenced by the same posterior distributions of the parameters $k$, $m$, and $\\delta$, which Stan samples during MCMC. These distributions are shared across all time steps, meaning that the trend at time $t = 30$ is drawn from the same parameter distributions as the trends at other time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Piecewise Linear Trend**:\n",
    "   - The trend is modeled as a **piecewise linear** function, where the slope (growth rate $k$) can change at specific **changepoints** $\\delta$.\n",
    "   - Before a changepoint, the trend follows the initial slope $k$. After a changepoint, the slope changes by $\\delta$, resulting in a new slope $k + \\delta$.\n",
    "   - This creates **continuity** in the trend across time steps, but with potential shifts at changepoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trend at Time-Step $t = 30$:\n",
    "For time $t = 30$, the trend is influenced by the values of $k$, $m$, and any changepoints before or at $t = 30$.\n",

    "- **Before Changepoint** (if no changepoint before $t = 30$): The trend evolves according to the original growth rate $k$.\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Trend}(t) = k \\cdot t + m\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  This formula applies to all time steps before any changepoint, so the trend at $t = 30$ will be closely related to the trend at, say, $t = 20$, with the same growth rate $k$ driving the trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **After Changepoint** (if there's a changepoint before $t = 30$): The growth rate adjusts by $\\delta$, and the trend at $t = 30$ will be based on the modified slope:\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{Trend}(t) = (k + \\delta) \\cdot t + m\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  This introduces a change in how the trend evolves compared to earlier time steps. Time steps before the changepoint would still be influenced by the original growth rate $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Trends Are Related Across Time Steps:\n",
    "- **Before Any Changepoints**: The trend follows the same linear growth driven by the **same parameters** $k$ and $m$, meaning the trends across time steps are related by a constant growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **After Changepoints**: If a changepoint happens before $t = 30$, the trend at $t = 30$ will have a different slope due to the change in the growth rate $\\delta$. However, the new slope will apply uniformly to all time steps after the changepoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Across the Entire Series**: Although the posterior distributions of $k$, $m$, and $\\delta$ affect all time steps, each time step’s trend is computed individually based on its position relative to the changepoints. The overall trend may shift piecewise, but each step is part of the broader trend model determined by the same set of parameter distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Is It the Same Distribution Affecting All Trends?\n",
    "Yes, **the same posterior distributions** of $k$, $m$, and $\\delta$ affect the trend across all time steps. However:\n",
    "- The effect of these parameters on the trend at each time step depends on whether a changepoint has occurred.\n",
    "- Before a changepoint, all time steps are driven by the same $k$ and $m$.\n",
    "- After a changepoint, the trend is adjusted by $\\delta$, but this new slope applies to all time steps moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- The trend at time $t = 30$ is related to the trends before it because the **same underlying parameter distributions** (growth rate $k$, intercept $m$, and changepoints $\\delta$) affect all time steps.\n",
    "- The trends across all time steps are influenced by the same posterior distributions, but the exact trend at each time step depends on where changepoints occur.\n",
    "- The trend is piecewise linear, so the growth rate may change at changepoints, but each time step’s trend is derived from the same probabilistic model."
