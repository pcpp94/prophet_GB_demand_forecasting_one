    "1. **$k \\sim \\text{normal}(0, 5)$:**\n",
    "   - $k$ represents the growth rate of the trend.\n",
    "   - It is assigned a normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation 5, indicating that the growth rate is expected to be around 0 with some uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **$m \\sim \\text{normal}(0, 5)$:**\n",
    "   - $m$ represents the offset or intercept of the trend.\n",
    "   - It is assigned a normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation 5, suggesting that the intercept is expected to be around 0 with some uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **$\\epsilon \\sim \\text{normal}(0, 0.5)$:**\n",
    "   - $\\epsilon$ typically represents noise or error terms, but it is not further used in the likelihood here.\n",
    "   - It is assigned a normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.5, indicating a small noise level.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **$\\delta \\sim \\text{double\\_exponential}(0, \\tau)$:**\n",
    "   - $\\delta$ represents the change points in the trend.\n",
    "   - It is assigned a double-exponential (Laplace) prior centered at 0 with scale parameter $\\tau$. This encourages sparsity in $\\delta$, meaning many changes will be close to 0, promoting a smooth trend with occasional abrupt changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **$\\beta \\sim \\text{normal}(0, \\sigma)$:**\n",
    "   - $\\beta$ represents the coefficients for the additional regressors.\n",
    "   - It is assigned a normal prior with mean 0 and standard deviation $\\sigma$, suggesting that the regressor coefficients are expected to be around 0 with some variability.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Stan model specifies priors for the parameters $k$, $m$, $\\epsilon$, $\\delta$, and $\\beta$. The likelihood function combines these parameters to model the observed data $y$ as a normal distribution with a mean that includes the trend (adjusted for changepoints), the offset, and the contribution of the additional regressors. The priors help regularize the model, promoting smooth trends with occasional changes, and incorporating the effects of external regressors."
